The [Monaco] font is beautiful and easy to recognize, and is generally considered to be a special font for writing code, while the [Menlo] font is very clear and is the font chosen after Monaco. Both are under Mac OS.

The [Source Code Pro] from Adobe is also very good to use, and it is continuously updated. The Source Code Pro font is not directly put in here.

Obtaining the Source Code Pro font: Download the latest version from the [Source Code Pro Latest] page, we only need the OTF file inside.
It is said that fonts in OTF format have better display effect than fonts in TTF format. Please refer to the [OpenType] encyclopedia.

####  Install
