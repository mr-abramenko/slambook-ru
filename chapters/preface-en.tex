\chapter*{Preface for English Version}
A lot of friends at Github asked me about this English version. I'm really sorry it takes so long to do the translation, and I'm glad to make it publicly available to help the readers. I encountered some issues with the math equations on the web pages. Since the book is originally written in LaTeX, I'm going to release the LaTeX source along with the compiled pdf. You can directly access the pdf version for the English book, and probably the publishing house is going to help me do the paper version.

As I'm not a native English speaker, the translation work is based on Google translation and some afterward modifications. If you think the quality of translation can be improved and willing to do this, please contact me or send an issue on Github. Any help will be welcome!

Thanks for the following friend's help in the translation time: Nicolas Rosa, Carrie (Yan Ran), Collen Jones, Hong Ma. And also, thanks for your attention and support!
